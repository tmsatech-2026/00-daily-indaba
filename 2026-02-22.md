# Daily Work — 2026-02-22

## Tasks

### 🔴 Priority
- [ ] 5. Sani Mountain Escape — day visitor booking communication campaign *(carried from 2026-02-21)*
  - Social media campaign educating people that day visits can only be booked within the current month — not in advance
  - Suggested by chairman of their tourism organisation (raised via Tsepo)
  - Root cause: likely a technical/system limitation — bookings close at end of month, can't book next month's day visits yet
  - ⚠️ Recommendation to raise with Tsepo: investigate whether the booking system can allow advance day visit bookings (e.g. 30 days ahead) — this would remove the friction entirely
- [ ] 8. RepresentCM — send designed pages for new website to client for feedback
- [ ] 25. Les Chambres — follow-up email after 2 Feb meeting *(carried from 2026-02-21)* — [[link]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isb2O-FjvC4GwRRieZf7ckr4bQmL7cspsBI_iMeEYUk/edit?tab=t.0)
  - Send follow-up with discussion points and next steps from 2 Feb meeting
- [ ] 38. Sani Mountain Escape — electric cars campaign: "coming up the pass" (BYD South Africa)
  - Tsepo's request: Share as special guest post/feature tagged with BYD South Africa
  - Campaign angle: Electric vehicles beginning to reach Sani Pass — positioning Sani Mountain Escape as eco-friendly destination
  - Context: Tsepo flagged this as timely opportunity
- [ ] 18. TERS Audit — Altitude Business Advisory — [[link]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16oXK1glg72FqzxeMtjlXZYyHnT6u--CUDVKFMDO4pSo/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
