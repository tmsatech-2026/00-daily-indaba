# Daily Work — 2026-02-20

## Tasks

### 🔴 Priority
- [x] 1. Guest Centre — release pending payments ✅
- [ ] 4. Les Chambres — invoice for boosted post (February) — campaign already ran, invoice now due
- [ ] 5. Sani Mountain Escape — day visitor booking communication campaign (TODAY)
- [ ] 17. VAT return — submit this weekend ⚠️
  - Social media campaign educating people that day visits can only be booked within the current month — not in advance
  - Suggested by chairman of their tourism organisation (raised via Tsepo)
  - Root cause: likely a technical/system limitation — bookings close at end of month, can't book next month's day visits yet
  - ⚠️ Recommendation to raise with Tsepo: investigate whether the booking system can allow advance day visit bookings (e.g. 30 days ahead) — this would remove the friction entirely
