## Notes

## Session Log

<!-- Auto-appended during session — do not edit manually -->

### 15:20 — CLAUDE.md created for daily work folder
Created `/Users/jacques/Documents/Claude/00-daily-work/CLAUDE.md` with session logging rules. Going forward, Claude will append a log entry to the daily file every time a task is completed, added, or a key decision is made. This replaces the lost-context problem from sessions ending without a record.

### 15:25 — Les Chambres invoicing clarified (two separate invoices)
Two distinct Les Chambres invoices needed: (1) February boosted post — campaign already ran, invoice now due. (2) March boosted post — confirmed moving to March, invoice to be prepared ahead of that campaign.

### 15:30 — Les Chambres: Charlotte confirmed Marisia Reel brief (WhatsApp)
Charlotte replied: "yes please to preparing updated version but no need to rush, why don't we do it for March and really target local SA market of Western Cape and further afield to get bookings in for mid-low season starting." This confirms the existing task — recreate Reel with royalty-free track, no rush, March campaign, mid-low season targeting.

### 15:35 — Sani Mountain Escape task updated with source context
Tsepo posted in the Sani Mountain (All) WhatsApp group on 11 Feb: chairman of their tourism org suggested a social media campaign to inform people that day visitor bookings can only be made within the same month (not in advance). Tsepo asked for "general thoughts" — task updated to reflect that a response/proposal is needed from us.

### 15:45 — Les Chambres: Charlotte's approval still outstanding on weekly social post
Dan has approved this week's post. Charlotte has not yet responded. First task tomorrow morning: follow up with Charlotte for sign-off before publishing.

### 16:00 — Flitwick invoice completed
Flitwick invoicing done and marked complete.

### 15:55 — Admin: VAT return added — due end of February
VAT return must be submitted before end of February. Added to admin tasks.

### 15:50 — Admin: Follow the Money Project appointment noted (Altitude Business Advisory)
Altitude Business Advisory has been appointed to the UIF panel for the "Follow the Money Project" — conducting UIF COVID-19 TERS audits on funds paid to employers and employees. Added as admin task; next steps TBD.

### 16:35 — Daily carry-forward and weekly report rules added to CLAUDE.md
Two new workflow rules: (1) Tomorrow's daily file is created by carrying forward all incomplete tasks from today — never start blank. (2) Every Friday, generate a week-YYYY-MM-DD.md summary of all completed tasks, grouped by client. Rules documented in CLAUDE.md.

### 16:30 — RepresentCM: check in with Tanita added for tomorrow morning
Need to check in with Tanita tomorrow morning on the status of the RepresentCM website project. Added to This Week tasks.

### 16:25 — RepresentCM invoice added — 2nd payment for website project
Second instalment invoice for the RepresentCM website project added to Admin due before tomorrow.

### 16:20 — End-of-month reporting workflow spec confirmed
Full brief captured: all retainer clients, 8 data sources (Metricool, GA4, Google Ads, Meta Ads, Facebook Insights, Instagram Insights, Google Search Console, Google Business Profile), HTML output (SEO audit style), Jacques reviews then emails to client with cover email. Next step: audit which sources have MCP/API access vs manual input required.

### 16:15 — Metricool MCP research completed
Big finding: Metricool has an official MCP server (github.com/metricool/mcp-metricool). No Composio or custom build needed. API access included in Advanced plan — need to confirm TMSA's current Metricool plan. If already on Advanced, setup cost is $0. Next step: install uv, add MCP server, test with a client brand. Task updated in Build section.

### 15:40 — Sani Mountain Escape: two campaigns now confirmed (WhatsApp today)
Tsepo messaged today (13:05): wants to "get cracking" on the day visitor bookings campaign in the meantime. Separately, photographer has completed a shoot covering rooms, activities, and surrounding areas — photos due in ~1.5 weeks. Tsepo planning a big campaign for end of February once photos are ready, and flagged significant website work on our side (updating accommodation section). Two tasks added to This Week.

### 17:00 — Sponsie website: hero background image + nav removed
Working session in `04-websites/03-sponsie/index.html`. Changes: (1) removed top nav header entirely (logo + Call Now button), (2) added background image to hero section using theragcompany.eu car detailing photo, (3) set `background-size: 100% auto` so full image is always visible left-to-right at any window width, (4) adjusted hero top padding from 130px to 60px. File saved — not deployed.

### 17:15 — End-of-day dashboard created
HTML dashboard created at `00-daily-work/dashboard-2026-02-19.html`. Dark theme, Space Grotesk font, tasks grouped by client (Les Chambres, Sani Mountain Escape, RepresentCM, Kunjani Villas) and internal category (Build, Admin). Stats row shows: 5 Priority, 4 This Week, 3 Build, 4 Admin, 2 Done. Opened in browser for review.

### 17:20 — Session sign-off
End of day. All tasks captured in this file. Tomorrow's first actions: (1) Guest Centre — release pending payments, (2) Charlotte approval on Les Chambres social post, (3) Tanita check-in on RepresentCM, (4) Les Chambres February invoice. Carry-forward file to be created at start of tomorrow's first task.

### 17:32 — Dashboard redesign: light theme + bigger text + visual section separation
Updated `dashboard-2026-02-19.html` with three major changes: (1) Switched from dark theme to light theme for better readability — dark navy background → soft gray (#e2e8f0), light text → dark navy. (2) Increased all font sizes significantly — titles +40%, task names +28%, subtitles +30%, badges +31%, section labels +26%. (3) Added visual divider between "Clients" and "Internal — Build & Admin" sections — added 2px border-top above section labels and increased font weight for better distinction. Dashboard is now much easier to read with better contrast and clearer visual hierarchy.

### 21:42 — Charlotte approved weekly Les Chambres social post ✅ + Dashboard updated to show "Completed This Week"
Les Chambres task completed: Charlotte's approval received on this week's social media post. Updated daily file and dashboard: (1) Marked task as [x] in Priority section. (2) Updated dashboard: task now shows as done/strikethrough, badge changed to green. (3) Changed bottom bar from "Completed Today" to "Completed This Week" showing all tasks completed during the week (Mon-Sun). (4) Updated stat card from "Done Today" (2) to "Done This Week" (3). Going forward, the completed section will show weekly totals, not daily.

### 21:50 — Dashboard workflow documented in CLAUDE.md
Added comprehensive "DASHBOARD WORKFLOW" section to `/Users/jacques/Documents/Claude/00-daily-work/CLAUDE.md`. Documents: (1) Styling standards (light theme #e2e8f0, font sizes: title 2.8rem, task names 1.05rem, etc.). (2) Visual separation: 2px border dividers between Client and Internal sections. (3) "Completed This Week" format showing Mon-Sun completions. (4) Regeneration process and when to trigger. Going forward, all dashboard work follows this documented standard.

### 21:58 — Dashboard template + design spec created
Created two reference files for consistent dashboard generation: (1) `dashboard-template.html` — master template showing exact HTML structure and CSS styling (all colors, fonts, spacing embedded). (2) `dashboard-design-spec.md` — complete design specification document (colors, typography scale, spacing, card structure, badge types, responsive rules). Updated CLAUDE.md with references to both files and new regeneration process: read daily file, reference template for structure, reference design-spec for styling details, replace placeholders, save and open. Ensures consistent styling across all future dashboards.

### 22:05 — GitHub Pages setup for external dashboard sharing
Created GitHub repo `00-daily-work` (https://github.com/tmsatech-2026/00-daily-work) with GitHub Pages enabled on main branch. Initialized local git repo in 00-daily-work folder, added remote, and pushed: dashboard-template.html, dashboard-design-spec.md, dashboard-2026-02-19.html, CLAUDE.md, and 2026-02-19.md. Dashboard now accessible externally via GitHub Pages: https://tmsatech-2026.github.io/00-daily-work/dashboard-2026-02-19.html. Updated CLAUDE.md with complete "GITHUB PAGES — External Sharing" section documenting repo URL, GitHub Pages link format, workflow for updating and sharing dashboards, and what files get pushed. Going forward: generate dashboard → push to repo → share GitHub Pages link with stakeholders.

### 22:12 — Config directory setup + README created
Copied dashboard-design-spec.md and tmsa-business-context.md to .claude/ config directory for easy reference. Updated CLAUDE.md to document config directory contents. Created comprehensive README.md for GitHub repo explaining: project purpose, quick links, file structure, dashboard features, how to share dashboards, technical details, naming conventions. README covers both internal workflow and external recipient perspective. All files committed and pushed to GitHub. Project setup complete: dashboard system fully documented, GitHub Pages live, and all reference materials in place.
