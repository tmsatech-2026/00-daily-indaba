# Daily Work — 2026-02-21

## Tasks

### 🔴 Priority
- [ ] 5. Sani Mountain Escape — day visitor booking communication campaign *(carried from 2026-02-20)*
  - Social media campaign educating people that day visits can only be booked within the current month — not in advance
  - Suggested by chairman of their tourism organisation (raised via Tsepo)
  - Root cause: likely a technical/system limitation — bookings close at end of month, can't book next month's day visits yet
  - ⚠️ Recommendation to raise with Tsepo: investigate whether the booking system can allow advance day visit bookings (e.g. 30 days ahead) — this would remove the friction entirely
- [ ] 8. RepresentCM — send designed pages for new website to client for feedback

## Session Log

### 09:00 — Daily file created (2026-02-21)
Carried forward all incomplete tasks from 2026-02-20. Added Task 34: Research — Cloudflare publishing via Wrangler CLI and API.

### 09:05 — Archive folder created
Enhancement applied: `archive/` folder created. Previous day files moved in (2026-02-19.md, 2026-02-20.md, dashboard-2026-02-19.html, dashboard-2026-02-20.html). Workflow documented in CLAUDE.md. Enhancement logged in enhancements.md.

### 09:20 — Model switched to Haiku 4.5
Set `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` in `.claude/settings.local.json`. Takes effect on next session restart. Running on Sonnet 4.6 for remainder of today's session.

### 09:30 — End of day
Session closed. Short session: created daily file, added Task 34 (Cloudflare research), implemented archive folder enhancement, switched model to Haiku for tomorrow. No tasks completed. Carry-forwards noted.

### 11:35 — Context restored: Completed tasks recovered
Found that 4 completed tasks from 2026-02-20 were lost when daily file was created fresh. Restored to daily file and updated dashboard: "Done This Week" now shows 4 (Guest Centre payment, Janno payment, enquiries spreadsheet, banking details).

### 11:40 — Weekly summary workflow implemented
Created `weekly-summary.md` to maintain persistent archive of weekly completions. New workflow: at start of each new week (Mon/Tue), capture previous week's completed tasks and add to `weekly-summary.md` before resetting daily file's Completed section. Updated CLAUDE.md with full documentation of: (1) Completed section now carries forward week's full total with dates, (2) Resets on Monday of new week, (3) Weekly summary updated at session start on new week. This prevents loss of context and creates historical record for productivity tracking.

### 11:45 — New task shortcut added
Added `new` shortcut to task management system. Workflow: Type `new` → describe task (text or image) → I extract and summarize task details, category, and context. Documented in CLAUDE.md with full workflow explanation and example. Enables fast task capture from various inputs (Slack messages, screenshots, images, etc.).

### 12:15 — Task 17 completed: VAT return submitted
VAT return submitted successfully — removes critical carry-forward flag for this weekend.

### 12:18 — New tasks added via `new` shortcut
Added Task 35: Upgrade Claude Pro subscription to Claude Max. Added Task 36 (pending): Get feedback from Jo about Jacques' Provisional Tax Month.

### 12:22 — Task 16 updated with Monday priority flag
Updated Task 16 (RepresentCM invoicing) to include website review links and flagged as Priority for Monday, 2026-02-23.

### 12:25 — `update` checkpoint: session preservation
**Verified:** All 31 open tasks + 5 completed tasks accurate. **Updated:** Carry-forward note clarified with Monday priorities (Tasks 16, 5, 4). **Status:** CLAUDE.md and enhancements.md current with enhanced `new` shortcut workflow. All changes committed to file.

### 12:30 — Dashboard consistency system implemented
Created `.claude/dashboard-generation-guide.md` with step-by-step checklist and verification process. Updated CLAUDE.md to reference guide as source of truth. Organized reference files: `dashboard-template.html` (root), `dashboard-design-spec.md` (`.claude/`), `dashboard-generation-guide.md` (`.claude/`). Ensures consistent, reproducible dashboard generation across all daily files going forward.

### 12:35 — Project cleanup & reorganization
**Deleted:** `.DS_Store` (macOS system file), `task-manager-tips.txt` (legacy notes). **Created `product/` folder** for marketing/external docs: moved `Daily-Work.html` (sales overview for GitHub sharing) and `diagram.html` (system overview for new users). **Consolidated `.claude/` folder:** moved `dashboard-design-spec.md` and `tmsa-business-context.md` here with generation guide. Root directory now cleaner with only operational files and templates. Updated CLAUDE.md with new file organization.

### 14:45 — Dashboard system finalized & optimized
Moved `dashboard-template.html` from root → `.claude/`. Updated CLAUDE.md and `dashboard-generation-guide.md` to clarify the process: read template → replace placeholders only → regenerate. Generated new dashboard-2026-02-21.html using proper template workflow with full card structure (icons, counts, task details). All reference files now consolidated in `.claude/`; only generated dashboards live in root.

### 14:50 — Task 35 completed: Claude Max upgrade
Upgraded Claude Pro → Claude Max subscription. Max plan supports heavy usage pattern (was hitting 100% weekly limit on Pro).

### 15:15 — Task 4 completed: Les Chambres invoice
