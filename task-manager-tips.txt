Top Tips: Daily Work Task Manager with Claude Code

1. Session Log — append a timestamped entry every time a task is completed or a key decision is made. Solves lost context between sessions.

2. Carry forward — copy all incomplete tasks from yesterday into today's file. Never start blank.

3. Fixed sections — use the same categories every day (Priority / This Week / Build / Admin / Completed / Session Log). No decision fatigue.

4. Label overdue explicitly — rename sections from "due tomorrow" to "overdue" so they stay visible until done.

5. HTML dashboard — the .md file is your source of truth; generate an HTML dashboard for at-a-glance review and sharing.

6. Completed This Week — track completions across the full week, not just today. Shows real momentum.

7. CLAUDE.md — document your own workflow rules so Claude stays consistent session to session without repeating yourself.

8. One-word shortcuts — tell Claude: "when I say tasks, show me today's list." Saves friction every session.

9. GitHub Pages — push the HTML dashboard to GitHub Pages for a shareable live URL. No login needed on their end.

10. Friday weekly summary — generate a week-YYYY-MM-DD.md with completed tasks grouped by client. Useful for billing and reporting.
