## 2. Core Mission

TMSA's core mission is:

> To help independent hospitality businesses compete effectively in a market dominated by large Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) by strengthening their direct digital presence and booking capability.

The agency focuses on:

- Maximising owned channels (website, email database, social platforms)
- Leveraging OTAs strategically for visibility (billboard effect)
- Driving traffic back to the property's own website
- Improving booking conversion rates
- Using data to continuously refine marketing performance

## 3. The Core Problem TMSA Solves

Independent accommodation providers face major challenges:

- OTAs like Booking.com and Tripadvisor dominate page 1 of Google
- Large marketing budgets from international brands
- High commission costs
- Reduced control over customer relationships
- Weak brand awareness

Example competitive search terms:

- "Guesthouses in Franschhoek"
- "Sani Pass accommodation"
- "Highest pub in Africa"

Search results are heavily populated by OTAs, making it difficult for independent properties to rank organically.

TMSA helps clients:

- Improve organic rankings (SEO)
- Run effective Google Ads campaigns
- Build strong social media communities
- Optimise conversion funnels
- Reduce commission dependency
